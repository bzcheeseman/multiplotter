I often find myself writing code in C++ that needs plots - for which the obvious 
choice is matplotlib.  It's a simple and robust plotting framework that 
works well in a number of situations.  This first commit is just for me to 
get the project out there, I'll shortly be adding bindings to C as well as 
figuring out how to install it as a library (and adding homebrew support?)

To see how to use the package look in main.cpp - that will show an example of each
plotting mode.
